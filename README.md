# Object Detection and Tracking Application

•	Developed an advanced objection and tracking system using YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and Deep SORT for robust object tracking. The implementation was done using TensorFlow 2 and Python.
•	Integrated YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately detect objects in video streams. 
•	Implemented Deep SORT, a powerful object tracking algorithm that utilizes both appearance and motion information for tracking objects across video frames.
•	Developed a video processing pipeline to read input videos, apply object detection and tracking, and generate output videos with annotated bounding boxes around tracked objects.
•	Incorporated a visually appealing feature by assigning random colors to tracked objects, enhancing the distinguishability of different tracks.
